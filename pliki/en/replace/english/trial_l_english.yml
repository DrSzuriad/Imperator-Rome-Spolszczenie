 trial.1.t: "Trial: Accusation"
 trial.1.desc_republic: "The senate hall slowly falls to silence as [SCOPE.sChar('target').GetName], the accused, is brought before them. As [SCOPE.sChar('target').Custom('random_character_adjective_negative')] a [SCOPE.sChar('target').GetWomanMan] [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] has never known - the senate murmurs in condemnation.\n\nThe social censure still hanging in the air, the examiner steps forward and addresses the senate, asking of which crime [SCOPE.sChar('target').GetPraenomen] stands accused."
 trial.1.desc_monarchy: "The atmosphere is dark in court as [SCOPE.sChar('target').GetName], the accused, is brought, head hanging, before the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRulerTitle]. [SCOPE.sChar('target').GetPraenomen|U], [SCOPE.sChar('target').Custom('get_council_1_descriptor')], has finally gone one step too far.\n\nKeen to expedite the trial, the examiner formally addresses [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRulerTitle] [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetPraenomen], asking what crime [SCOPE.sChar('target').GetPraenomen] stands accused of."
 trial.1.desc_tribal: "The tribal chiefs sit impassively as [SCOPE.sChar('target').GetName] is led before them. Few sympathetic faces can be seen in the assembly of clans.\n\nThe magistrate bellows, and the scathing voices of condemnation fall silent. As the veil of order descends, the magistrate addresses [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRulerTitle] [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetPraenomen], asking of which crime [SCOPE.sChar('target').GetPraenomen] stands accused."
 trial.1.a: "Abuse of office is a serious matter."
 trial.1.b: "The people demand it. No other crime is required."
 trial.1.c: "Does it matter? [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetPraenomen] is [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRulerTitle]!"

 trial.2.t: "Trial: A Technicality"
 trial.2.desc: "As the hours draw on, members of the [ROOT.GetCountry.Custom('get_court_type')] begin to grow weary with the constant questioning, vitriol, and drama. [SCOPE.sChar('target').GetPraenomen] finally takes the floor, waxing lyrical on the subject of [SCOPE.sChar('target').GetHerHis] eternal loyalty to [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName].\n\nAs [SCOPE.sChar('target').GetPraenomen] speaks, a curious smile creases [SCOPE.sChar('target').GetHerHis] face. It seems that whilst drawing up details of the accusation, our examiners had neglected to check the whereabouts of [SCOPE.sChar('target').GetPraenomen] on the eve of [SCOPE.sChar('target').GetHerHis] supposed criminal activity - [SCOPE.sChar('target').GetSheHe] was in fact visiting [SCOPE.sC('alibi_country').GetName] on a diplomatic mission."

 trial.3.t: "Trial: Unexpected Interference"
 trial.3.desc: "As matters progress in the trial of [SCOPE.sChar('target').GetName], an unexpected figure enters the [ROOT.GetCountry.Custom('get_court_type')]. Flanked by burly soldiers, [SCOPE.sChar('powerful_ally').GetName] takes a seat beside [SCOPE.sChar('target').GetPraenomen], and whispers in [SCOPE.sChar('target').GetHerHis] ear.\n\n[SCOPE.sChar('target').GetPraenomen] nods, and rises to speak once again. It appears that [SCOPE.sChar('target').GetSheHe] is now vouched for by [SCOPE.sChar('powerful_ally').GetPraenomen] of the [SCOPE.sChar('powerful_ally').GetFamilyDisplayName] family. We should tread carefully; as [SCOPE.sChar('powerful_ally').GetPraenomen] wields considerable influence."
 trial.3.a: "Hah! [SCOPE.sChar('powerful_ally').GetPraenomen] cannot scare us."
 trial.3.b: "Perhaps [SCOPE.sChar('powerful_ally').GetPraenomen] can be reasoned with?"

 trial.4.t: "Trial: Culpability"
 trial.4.desc: "It emerges over the course of the trial, that [SCOPE.sChar('target').GetName] is a particularly nervous [SCOPE.sChar('target').GetWomanMan]. Faced with endless accusations, censure, and the rising choler of an angry [ROOT.GetCountry.Custom('get_court_type')], [SCOPE.sChar('target').GetSheHe] begins to crack.\n\nWith tears streaming from [SCOPE.sChar('target').GetHerHis] eyes, [SCOPE.sChar('target').GetPraenomen] throws [SCOPE.sChar('target').GetHerselfHimself] at the feet of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRulerTitle] [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetPraenomen], admitting [SCOPE.sChar('target').GetHerHis] guilt, and begging for forgiveness."

 trial.5.t: "Trial: Misdirection"
 trial.5.desc: "In the midst of a rousing and self-congratulatory monologue, [SCOPE.sChar('target').GetName] pauses, with dramatic effect. Wheeling around, [SCOPE.sChar('target').GetSheHe] points directly at [SCOPE.sChar('scapegoat').GetName], who happens to be attending the [ROOT.GetCountry.Custom('get_court_type')].\n\nIn a shaking voice, [SCOPE.sChar('target').GetPraenomen] accuses [SCOPE.sChar('scapegoat').GetPraenomen] of masterminding the whole affair, leading to much of the [ROOT.GetCountry.Custom('get_court_type')] joining [SCOPE.sChar('target').GetHerHis] side."
 trial.5.a: "This may be true... but they must be in it together!"
 trial.5.b: "Nonsense - [SCOPE.sChar('scapegoat').GetPraenomen] is an honorable [SCOPE.sChar('scapegoat').GetWomanMan]."

 trial.6.desc: "Times passes, as a litany of bellicose rivals attempt amateur character assassination against [SCOPE.sChar('target').GetName]. [SCOPE.sChar('target').GetSheHe|U] grows visibly more anxious as the tirade continues, until - suddenly, and to the surprise of all present, [SCOPE.sChar('target').GetSheHe] leaps up, and makes a dash for the nearest exit.\n\nThe sudden pandemonium is cut short, as [SCOPE.sChar('target').GetName] accidentally runs directly into [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRulerTitle] [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetPraenomen], with both ending up sprawled upon the floor."
 trial.6.a: "That wretch! Guilty as sin."

 trial.7.t: "Trial: Self-Incrimination"
 trial.7.desc: "During a dull, and frankly amateurish defense, [SCOPE.sChar('target').GetName] works [SCOPE.sChar('target').GetHerselfHimself] into quite a tricky situation. We remain unsure quite how, but rather than professing innocence, [SCOPE.sChar('target').GetPraenomen] seems to have mistakenly assumed that [SCOPE.sChar('target').GetSheHe] was acting on behalf of the prosecution, and accused [SCOPE.sChar('target').GetHerselfHimself] of a wide variety of crimes.\n\nNow might be a good chance to push the advantage."
 trial.7.a: "Invest in a few favors, to turn this into a win."
 trial.7.b: "We hardly need to, at this rate."
