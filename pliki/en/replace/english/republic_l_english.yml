 optimates_party: "Optimates"
 optimates_party_description: "The Optimates are the elite of our nation, rich and powerful senators who want to divide the power of the Republic between themselves rather than letting the unwashed masses affect the rule of law.\n\nThey approve of changes made for the established greater families and elite, and hold a deep disdain for any would be populist upstart."

 populares_party: "Populares"
 populares_party_description: "The Populares are the senators who work for the common man, or at least claim so to get popular backing and make their own political platforms relevant. Popular generals and corrupt politicians have a tendency to join this party, as it lets them toss aside ancient traditions that might negatively affect their own rise to power.\n\nThey approve of actions that reduce the influence of the Optimates, and disagree with any moves to cement the control of the upper class."

 boni_party: "Boni"
 boni_party_description: "The Boni are aristocrats who believe in the ancient traditions of the nation, rather than taking parts in the conflicts between classes like the Optimates or Populares. They strive to find a balance between the needs of the lower classes and upholding the stability of the nation, through gradual reform.\n\nThey approve of leaders who actively seek to preserve the peace and stability of the nation, and disapprove of anything that would break the current balance."

 oligarchic_party: "Oligarchs"
 oligarchic_party_description: "The Oligarchs are the ancient nobles of our nation, and their supporters, who seek to dominate the political life of the country to their own ends and benefit. As such they eschew, and at best tolerate, the participation of the general populace in politics, which is a threat to their privileged status."

 democratic_party: "Democrats"
 democratic_party_description: "The Democrats ostensibly support a fairer division of political power and participation in the country, protecting the interests of citizens and non-citizens alike to their own advantage. They are a foil to the domination of the entrenched Oligarchs, though the motives of their politicians are often equally devious and ambitious."

 monthly_democratic_party_conviction: "Monthly Democratic Conviction"
 traditionalist_party: "Traditionalists"
 traditionalist_party_description: "The Traditionalists are generally not concerned with the political divide that drives the debates of the Oligarchs and Democrats.

 republic_button_empower_faction_desc_loc_optimates: "The Optimates are always trying to alter the assemblies in their favor in order to gain even greater influence over the Republic.

 republic_button_empower_faction_desc_loc_boni: "The Boni are known for eschewing newer trends and ideas in favor of old ones, holding ancient [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCharacter.GetEmployer.GetPrimaryCulture.GetName] ways as a lofty standard with which few others can compete.
