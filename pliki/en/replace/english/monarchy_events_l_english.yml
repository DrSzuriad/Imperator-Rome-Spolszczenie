 monarchy_events.35.t: "Counter-shame"
 monarchy_events.35.desc: "No matter how much time and energy we have spent trying to mock [SCOPE.sCharacter('primary_heir').GetName], it has somehow been turned around on [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] instead. It has gotten worse by the day, and [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] can barely leave [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetHerHis] home at this point.\n\nIt seems our heir is sufficient at dodging our attempts at shaming [SCOPE.sCharacter('primary_heir').GetHerHim], unless [SCOPE.sCharacter('primary_heir').GetSheHe] has some sort of benefactor protecting [SCOPE.sCharacter('primary_heir').GetHerHim]. "
 monarchy_events.35.a: "But... No!"
 monarchy_events.38.t: "A Daughter to be Heir"
 monarchy_events.38.desc: "For a long time [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] has had to deal with [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetHerHis] spouse and [SCOPE.sCharacter('ruler_spouse').GetHerHis] overbearing attitude, particularly now that [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetSheHe] has no proper heir to follow [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetHerHis] rule. The latest of these are [SCOPE.sCharacter('ruler_spouse').GetHerHis] attempts at having [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] pass a law that allows daughters to be heirs to the nation.\n\nIt would surely secure the succession of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName], but it could prove to be somewhat of an unpopular decision. "
 monarchy_events.38.a: "Sounds like a good idea."
 monarchy_events.38.b: "Nonsense!"
 monarchy_events.39.t: "Pirates Ahoy!"
 monarchy_events.39.desc: "A messenger has been sent by [SCOPE.sCharacter('character_marshal').GetName] from [SCOPE.sP('random_port_province').GetName]. A fleet of pirates has attacked the port, and it does not look like they are going to let up any time soon. [SCOPE.sCharacter('character_marshal').GetSheHe|U|] is asking for aid immediately, to put an end to this.\n\nSome of our other advisors at court has suggested making a more permanent change to our laws, to make sure this problem will not resurface in a couple of years. "
 monarchy_events.39.a: "The system needs to be changed to fix this."
 monarchy_events.39.b: "[SCOPE.sCharacter('character_marshal').GetSheHe|U|] can deal with it."
 monarchy_events.39.c: "They will move from our shores in time."
 monarchy_events.40.t: "Master or Not"
 monarchy_events.40.desc: "Lately [SCOPE.sCharacter('character_master_guard').GetName] has proven to be an unreliable aid at court, time and time again. Having the Master of the Guards [SCOPE.sCharacter('character_master_guard').GetHerselfHimself] disloyal to the throne could prove fatal for our ruler, if we are not careful. It would not be the first time a ruler is brought down by their closest aides.\n\nWe could try to win the [SCOPE.sCharacter('character_master_guard').GetWomanMan] over with some gold, or maybe it is time to replace [SCOPE.sCharacter('character_master_guard').GetHerHim] with someone more loyal. "
 monarchy_events.40.a: "We will get rid of [SCOPE.sCharacter('character_master_guard').GetHerHim]."
 monarchy_events.40.b: "Some gold will appease the [SCOPE.sCharacter('character_master_guard').GetWomanMan]."
 monarchy_events.40.c: "[SCOPE.sCharacter('character_master_guard').GetSheHe|U|] will come around eventually. "
 monarchy_events.41.t: "Citizens for [SCOPE.sCountry('allied_neighbor').GetName]"
 monarchy_events.41.desc: "We are informed that a group of citizens are preparing to move from [SCOPE.sP('randomized_country_province').GetName] to [SCOPE.sP('randomized_neighbor_province').GetName], one of the regions of our ally [SCOPE.sCountry('allied_neighbor').GetName]. It is said having a better understanding of our two cultures could bring us ever closer, but it would certainly weaken us if all our people start leaving [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]."
 monarchy_events.41.a: "It will only bring our countries closer."
 monarchy_events.41.b: "Those are OUR citizens!"
 monarchy_events.41.c: "[SCOPE.sP('randomized_country_province').GetName] will be a place people want to travel to, not from."
 monarchy_events.42.t: "The Citizens of [SCOPE.sP('randomized_country_province').GetName]"
 monarchy_events.42.desc: "A group of citizens from [SCOPE.sCountry('original_country').GetName] has appeared in [SCOPE.sP('randomized_neighbor_province').GetName], looking for new homes. Apparently they have not only been allowed to leave [SCOPE.sCountry('original_country').GetName], but has been sent with the best wishes from their monarch [SCOPE.sCountry('original_country').GetRuler.GetName] to our ruler [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName].\n\nThis well meaning gesture should not go unnoticed, as they have clearly tried their best to bring our two nations closer."
 monarchy_events.42.a: "It is only right to assure our allies with a small gift for their troubles."
 monarchy_events.42.b: "We will be ever closer."
 monarchy_events.43.t: "An Ally's Gift"
 monarchy_events.43.desc: "It has been some weeks since our people left for [SCOPE.sCountry('allied_neighbor').GetName], when a messenger with a gift of gold appears at our court. It seems our allies are grateful for the gesture, and wanted to make a friendly gesture of their own to thank us. "
 monarchy_events.43.a: "We appreciate this gift."
 monarchy_events.44.t: "The Statue of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName]"
 monarchy_events.44.desc: "The people of [SCOPE.sP('randomized_country_province').GetName] have raised a large statue of our esteemed ruler [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName]. Though the statue is lacking in certain important areas, it would not be taken well if we were to rip it down. If we leave the statue up, let us hope it does not get too well known, as it could be somewhat of an insult to the monarch."
 monarchy_events.44.a: "We are grateful for this honor to the nation."
 monarchy_events.44.b: "That looks nothing like [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetPraenomen], rip it down."
 monarchy_events.45.t: "Speech of a Successor"
 monarchy_events.45.desc: "As the ruler of the one true successor to the great empire of Alexander, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] steps up on a podium infront of our countrymen and court to deliver an inspiring speech. [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetSheHe|U|] brings up the many empowering properties of the old conqueror, but [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetSheHe] decides to bring up one topic in particular. "
 monarchy_events.45.a: "The great campaigns."
 monarchy_events.45.b: "Many of the systems Alexander put into place."
 monarchy_events.45.c: "Bringing together people from all across the known world."
 monarchy_events.45.d: "His deification."
