 gladiator.1.t: "Trial by Combat"
 gladiator.1.draw: "The day for the trial by combat arrived; with [SCOPE.sChar('target').GetPraenomen] receiving [ROOT.GetCountry.Custom('get_applause_type_glad')] applause upon entering the arena, swiftly followed by [SCOPE.sChar('recipient').GetPraenomen].\n\nTheir duel to the death dragged on for much of the day, with the crowd beginning to lose interest as the hours progressed.\n\nEventually, both participants, too weary to stand, grasped each others' hands, and appealed to us for clemency. With the crowd in a state of agreement, our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRulerTitle] had no choice but to grant freedom to both nascent gladiators."
 gladiator.1.victory: "[ROOT.GetCountry.Custom('fight_intro_glad')], and [ROOT.GetCountry.Custom('get_applause_type_glad')] applause; [SCOPE.sChar('recipient').GetPraenomen] and [SCOPE.sChar('target').GetPraenomen] took to the sands this day, to fight for their very survival in the arena.\n\nThe crowd responded well to the [ROOT.GetCountry.Custom('get_duel_type_glad')] fight, and the outcome seemed uncertain to the last, until, to [ROOT.GetCountry.Custom('get_applause_type_glad')] jubilation, [SCOPE.sChar('winner').GetPraenomen] [ROOT.GetCountry.Custom('get_deathstroke_glad')] [SCOPE.sChar('loser').GetPraenomen] with a [ROOT.GetCountry.Custom('get_arena_death_implement_glad')].\n\nWith great pomp, our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRulerTitle] declared [SCOPE.sChar('winner').GetName] the victor, to be granted freedom immediately."
