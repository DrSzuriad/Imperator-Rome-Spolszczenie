 dhe_rome.1.desc_1: "The recent work of plebeian jurist Gnaeus Flavius, his Legis Actiones or Actions in Law, is the first written account of the legal procedures of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]. The importance of this work propelled him to the office of Tribune of the Plebs and garnered him wide populist support.\n\nThe full extent and interpretation of our laws has, until now, been a verbal tradition of our judiciary, and Flavius' attempt to codify parts of our legal procedures for a wider audience has not been wholly appreciated.\n\nSome patricians argue a public airing of our sacred laws, by a plebeian no less, threatens their traditional prerogative over government positions and the laws of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName], while the populists welcome greater rights and participation for the plebs."

The importance of this work propelled him to the office of Tribune of the Plebs and garnered him wide populist support, a legacy which is now being celebrated by politicians like [SCOPE.sChar('dhe_rome_gnaeus_flavius_scope').GetName].\n\nThe full extent and interpretation of our laws has, until now, been a verbal tradition of our judiciary, and Flavius' attempt to codify parts of our legal procedures for a wider audience has not been wholly appreciated.\n\nSome patricians argue a public airing of our sacred laws, by a plebeian no less, threatens their traditional prerogative over government positions and the laws of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName], while the populists welcome greater rights and participation for the plebs."
 dhe_rome.1.a: "Transparency can only benefit our legal system."
 dhe_rome.1.b: "We cannot undo the damage, but we can control it."
 dhe_rome.2.t: "Conflict of the Orders"
 dhe_rome.2.desc: "In spite of the rights granted to plebeians since the last Secession in 411, tension between the patrician and plebeian classes of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] has been growing lately, partly influenced by the work of Gnaeus Flavius, among others. None of our concessions have dampened the plebeians determination to secure political and legal equality.\n\nHowever, a new political class made up of both patricians and plebeians has been growing, incorporating the middle income families of the republic. We must decide whether to promote the expansion of this new Nobilitas as a middle ground, or give in to the populist's demands for reform."
 dhe_rome.2.a: "Perhaps encouraging this new 'middle-class' could be the solution."
 dhe_rome.2.b: "Only real reform will truly resolve the issue."
 dhe_rome.2.bt: "The plebeians will be upset if this #Y Integration Law#! is changed before the Conflict is resolved."
 dhe_rome.3.t: "Secession of the Plebs"
 dhe_rome.3.desc_1: "The political debate of the patricians and plebeians has once again escalated into a full blown Secession. It seems promoting the new middle-class, while satisfying some of the wealthy plebeians and encouraging social mobility, only ostracized the rest of the population further.\n\nThe city has ground to a halt with thousands of freemen leaving the city to occupy the hill of Janiculum across the Tiber. Their leaders are demanding legal and political equality to end the strike."
 dhe_rome.3.desc_2: "The political debate of the patricians and plebeians has once again escalated into a full blown Secession. Although prior governments passed the requested reforms, the plebeians claim that the revocation of the Lex Hortensia is a betrayal of the promises of the Senate and demand that the laws be reinstated immediately.\n\nThe city has ground to a halt with thousands of freemen leaving the city to occupy the hill of Janiculum across the Tiber. Their leaders are demanding legal and political equality to end the strike."
 dhe_rome.3.a: "What choice to do we have?"
 dhe_rome.3.b: "We must reinstate the promised concessions."
 dhe_rome.3.c: "They are outside the pomerium. Let us teach them a lesson."
 dhe_rome.4.t: "Expansion of the Tribes"
 dhe_rome.4.desc: "Since Romulus founded our great city, its citizens have been divided into the tribes. Originally it was an ethnic distinction but since the Republic was formed the tribes have been divisions of eligible citizens whose local consensus is submitted as a vote in the Tribal Assembly in [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName].\n\nThe number of tribes has fluctuated throughout our history, beginning with merely three, there are now over thirty, added or redrawn as our state has grown. New tribes are formed as our citizen population rises to better represent the opinions of the whole Republic.\n\nThere have lately been calls to create two more tribes, to be named Aniensis and Terentina, to ensure votes are fairly distributed."
 dhe_rome.4.a: "This should please the provinces."
 dhe_rome.4.b: "We have enough tribes."
 dhe_rome.5.t: "Expansion of the Tribes"
 dhe_rome.5.desc: "Today's tribes are much changed from the strict geographic constituencies of the past, now consisting of a vertical slice of citizens from any one of the provinces. Although there are only four tribes within the city of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName] itself, the rural tribes are a valuable source of political legitimacy and play an important role in organizing the bureaucracy of the state, from electing local magistrates to passing motions by the Tribunes of the Plebs.\n\n[ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] has grown far beyond the borders of Latium, and with the large increase in population there are again calls to instantiate more tribes for the Republic. In response, the Senate is debating the commission of two further tribes, to be named Quirina and Velina respectively."
 dhe_rome.5.a: "Our system requires granularity."
 dhe_rome.5.b: "We have enough tribes..."
 dhe_rome.6.t: "Development of Roman Law"
 dhe_rome.6.desc: "Our legal system has grown substantially as it tries to keep pace with the needs of an expanding population and the evolving social structure of the state. As a result, specialist jurists, often plebeians, have become a social caste unto themselves who supplement the work of judges and magistrates.\n\nThe Legis Actiones has been supplemented by the Laws of the Twelve Tables, providing far greater transparency for plebeians, and a more simple and open interpretation of the law is emerging with the introduction of legal precedents, or case law, in determining sentences."
 dhe_rome.6.a: "A surprise to be sure, but a welcome one."
 dhe_rome.7.t: "The Great Transformation"
 dhe_rome.7.desc: "The expansion of the state has lead to large parcels of private farmland becoming concentrated in enormous provincial estates known as Latifundia. These estates have a reputation for the extensive use of slaves as well as directing their production towards profit oriented export products rather than grain for the population.\n\nWhile these estates make us a great deal of money, the owners of smaller farms and some populist politicians who are beginning to feel marginalized by these enterprises have lobbied for the curtailment of the latifundia system."
 dhe_rome.7.a: "These developments suit our situation."
 dhe_rome.7.b: "The plebeians should be appeased."
 dhe_rome.8.t: "Increased Social Tensions"
 dhe_rome.8.desc: "As [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] has grown, our once vitally important permanent allies in Italy, known as the Socii, have become increasingly less important. Their diminishing significance has not been lost on them, with the privileges and attention the Socii formerly received falling into decline.\n\nThey are particularly irritated by the what they see as the encroachment of our citizens into their lands, who they claim are settling unlawfully. Thus they accuse us of favoring newly conquered peoples and citizens while disenfranchising our old and loyal allies who are not classed as citizens of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]."
 dhe_rome.8.a: "This will all blow over."
 dhe_rome.8.b: "We must not lose their support."

 dhe_rome.9.desc: "We have been attacked by the powerful trading empire of [SCOPE.sC('dhe_rome_carthage_scope').GetName]! Many predicted this would befall us eventually, but without assistance we have little chance of defeating the invaders.\n\nThe prevailing mood is that our only hope is send an envoy in supplication to [SCOPE.sC('dhe_rome_rome_scope').GetName], a natural rival of [SCOPE.sC('dhe_rome_carthage_scope').GetName], begging them to intervene on our behalf."
 dhe_rome.9.a: "We must send for help."

How should we respond?"
 dhe_rome.10.a: "[SCOPE.sC('dhe_rome_carthage_scope').GetName] must be destroyed."
 dhe_rome.10.b: "We are not ready for war. Yet."

We may yet be able to maintain our independence with Roman blood.\n\nLet us hope they do not dally..."

The cowards said they were not ready for a war with [SCOPE.sC('dhe_rome_carthage_scope').GetName].\n\nLet us hope the gods are kind to us."
 dhe_rome.11.desc_3: "Our envoy has returned from [SCOPE.sC('dhe_rome_rome_scope').GetName] with the news that they refused to help us! The cowards showed no interest in our plight.\n\nMay the gods treat them as kindly as they have treated us."

 dhe_rome.12.t: "Conflict of the Orders"
 dhe_rome.12.desc_1: "The fractious years of the Conflict of the Orders have finally been put behind us; the promised legal reforms of populist politicians successfully eased the main grievances of the plebeians, despite attempts by other parties to undo their work. By maintaining their legal rights we have satisfied the main grievances of the plebeians, removing their political incentive to revolt. While some patricians may doubt the course we chose, there is no doubt that the populists ensured stability."

While some patricians may doubt the course we chose, there is no doubt that the populists ensured stability."
 dhe_rome.12.desc_3: "The fractious years of the Conflict of the Orders have ended in disaster; the promised legal reforms of populist politicians were constantly rescinded, undermining their efforts to ease the main grievances of the plebeians. The failure to maintain their legal rights and political equality has reinvigorated the plebeians political incentive to revolt.\n\nThey have once again marched in Secession to the hill of Janiculum, this time bearing arms and organized by disgruntled defecting soldiers. They demand that the senate be dissolved and replaced with the plebeian assemblies of the city."
 dhe_rome.12.desc_4: "The fractious years of the Conflict of the Orders have finally been put behind us; the encouragement of an aspirational plebeian sub-class combined with greater political participation and equality before the law has satisfied the main grievances of the plebeians, removing their political incentive to revolt."

 dhe_rome.12.b: "Why didn't we just let it lie..."
 dhe_rome.15.t: "Rapid Assembly"
 dhe_rome.15.desc: "After suffering a crushing defeat at the hands of the numerous, and fiercely competent Carthaginian navy, our fleet has slunk back to port with many hands lost.\n\nAll however, is not as devastating as it may appear. Amongst the surviving Roman vessels, a lone Carthaginian quadrireme sits; captured after it strayed too close to the retreating navy. Upon inspection by our shipwrights, a startling discovery was made - the Carthaginians, in a feat of engineering ingenuity, have numbered each plank, rib, and oar that make up the vessel, rendering construction of such majestic warships a matter of almost arbitrary skill.\n\nAdopting such a practice could hugely increase our potential for fielding a vast navy, perhaps even rivaling that of the Phoenicians themselves?"
