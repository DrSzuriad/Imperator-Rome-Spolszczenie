 pbc_event.1.t: "The Treasury of [SCOPE.sChar('power_character').GetName]"
 pbc_event.1.desc: "It seems [SCOPE.sChar('power_character').GetName] has gotten [SCOPE.sChar('power_character').GetHerHis] hands on a lot of wealth, as [SCOPE.sChar('power_character').GetSheHe] has started investing a great deal of silver into building a reputation for [SCOPE.sChar('power_character').GetHerselfHimself] lately. Though it is unclear exactly where [SCOPE.sChar('power_character').GetSheHe] found these riches, [SCOPE.sChar('power_character').GetHerHis] efforts are surprisingly effective.\n\nWith [SCOPE.sChar('power_character').GetHerHis] increased popularity, [SCOPE.sChar('power_character').GetPraenomen] has started vying for a more powerful position in [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName], shamelessly comparing [SCOPE.sChar('power_character').GetHerselfHimself] to our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRulerTitle], [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName]."
 pbc_event.1.a: "[SCOPE.sChar('power_character').GetSheHe|U] will quiet down in time, hopefully."
 pbc_event.1.b: "Time to share with the rest of us, [SCOPE.sChar('power_character').GetPraenomen]!"
 pbc_event.1.c: "We know a way to stop [SCOPE.sChar('power_character').GetHerHis] criticisms."
 pbc_event.1.d: "[SCOPE.sChar('power_character').GetSheHe|U] likes gold, right?"
 pbc_event.2.t: "The Second Insult of [SCOPE.sChar('power_character').GetPraenomen]"
 pbc_event.2.desc: "A few months have passed since [SCOPE.sChar('power_character').GetPraenomen] came into a tidy sum of gold, and the first time we heard about [SCOPE.sChar('power_character').GetHerHis] insults to our rulership of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]. \n\nNow, during a large gathering at one of [SCOPE.sChar('power_character').GetHerHis] villas just outside of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName], [SCOPE.sChar('power_character').GetSheHe] has apparently compared [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] to an incapable farm animal, and called the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.Custom('get_city_type_loc')] of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName] a ruined husk of a capital."
 pbc_event.2.a: "Probably just a slip of the tongue..."
 pbc_event.2.b: "Let us see if [SCOPE.sChar('power_character').GetSheHe] prefers the dungeon to [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName]."
 pbc_event.2.c: "You just will not learn, will you [SCOPE.sChar('power_character').GetPraenomen]?"
 pbc_event.3.t: "The Final Insult of [SCOPE.sChar('power_character').GetPraenomen]"
 pbc_event.3.desc: "As there have been no repercussions to [SCOPE.sChar('power_character').GetHerHis] insults so far, [SCOPE.sChar('power_character').GetPraenomen] has continued mocking [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetPraenomen] for the last couple of months.\n\nIn the latest barrage of deeply insulting descriptions of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName], a man suddenly charged forward and attacked [SCOPE.sChar('power_character').GetHerHim]. Somehow this man disappeared into the audience in the chaos that ensued, though it was supposedly heard that he felt he had to put an end to the arrogance of [SCOPE.sChar('power_character').GetPraenomen], because nobody else would."
 pbc_event.3.a: "Thanks?"
 pbc_event.4.t: "New Military Structure"
 pbc_event.4.desc: "It seems [SCOPE.sChar('power_character').GetPraenomen] has really taken to [SCOPE.sChar('power_character').GetHerHis] job as a general, as [SCOPE.sChar('power_character').GetSheHe] has started reworking the whole infrastructure of the troops assigned to him. However, with these changes we have started seeing a lot of officers and troops who are loyal to the general over [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName], a troubling development for what the future might hold."
 pbc_event.4.a: "[SCOPE.sChar('power_character').GetPraenomen] knows best."
 pbc_event.4.a.tt: "Up to #Y 50%#! of the troops assigned to [SCOPE.sChar('power_character').GetName] will become loyal."
 pbc_event.4.b: "It is time to intervene and put an end to this nonsense."
 pbc_event.4.c: "Let us counteract some of these meassures."
 pbc_event.4.c.tt: "Up to #Y 10%#! of the troops assigned to [SCOPE.sChar('power_character').GetName] will become loyal."
 pbc_event.4.d: "Some well placed gifts will fix this issue."
 pbc_event.5.t: "The Corrupt Governor of [SCOPE.sGovernorship('affected_governorship').GetName]"
 pbc_event.5.desc: "It seems the governor of [SCOPE.sGovernorship('affected_governorship').GetName] has been taking advantage of [SCOPE.sChar('power_character').GetHerHis] position to such a degree that [SCOPE.sChar('power_character').GetSheHe] has left the people of [SCOPE.sState('affected_province').GetShortName] destitute. Some of our confidants who have passed through the province talks of desperate situations of unfortunate souls who barely cling to life.\n\nNot only has [SCOPE.sChar('power_character').GetName] not taken care of those under [SCOPE.sChar('power_character').GetHerHis] rule, but [SCOPE.sChar('power_character').GetSheHe] has taken advantage of the situation for the sake of personal wealth."
 pbc_event.5.a: "Is this not what all governors do?"
 pbc_event.5.b: "Outrageous! Let us send some administrators to fix up [SCOPE.sChar('power_character').GetHerHis] mess."
 pbc_event.5.c: "Let us send the people of [SCOPE.sState('affected_province').GetShortName] what they need."
 pbc_event.5.d: "And where is our cut?"
 pbc_event.6.t: "Rival at Court"
 pbc_event.6.desc: "Lately, our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRulerTitle] [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] has come into conflict with [SCOPE.sChar('power_character').GetName] at every turn and decision, their opinions persistently clashing. If one of them says south, the other will promptly say north. If one wants to trade with a neighbor, the other will argue for war.\n\nThis constant bickering is ruining whatever authority [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetPraenomen] used to have, and the atmosphere in [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName] is at a breaking point."
 pbc_event.6.a: "\"FINE! Have your will then [SCOPE.sChar('power_character').GetPraenomen]!\""
 pbc_event.6.b: "\"Enough of this nonsense, you are not the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRulerTitle]!\""
 pbc_event.6.c: "\"So it is a fight you want, [SCOPE.sChar('power_character').GetPraenomen]?\""
 pbc_event.6.d: "\"Maybe we can be friends if we do as [SCOPE.sChar('power_character').GetSheHe] says?\""
 pbc_event.7.t: "Questionable Legitimacy"
 pbc_event.7.desc: "Our claim to the throne of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] has come into question repeatedly lately, and people do not really see us fit to be their ruler.\n\nEven among the higher echelons of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] society, there are those who question us. [SCOPE.sChar('power_character').GetPraenomen] is a name that repeatedly comes up in these cases, clearly one who doubts our right to rule."
 pbc_event.7.a: "Who really cares about [SCOPE.sChar('power_character').GetHerHis] opinion though?"
 pbc_event.7.b: "We will have our people convince [SCOPE.sChar('power_character').GetHerHim], one way or another."
 pbc_event.7.c: "We will convince [SCOPE.sChar('power_character').GetHerHim] ourselves."
 pbc_event.8.t: "Disagreeable [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRulerTitle]"
 pbc_event.8.desc: "Lately we have seen a lot of disagreements between [SCOPE.sChar('power_character').GetName] and [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] on how [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] should be ruled. Both of them are trying to push their own agendas through the Senate, often conflicting and even scheduling their debates to coincide with one another.\n\nNow a group of [SCOPE.sChar('power_character').GetPartyName] loyalists have approached [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetPraenomen] about switching their loyalties to the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetPartyName] instead. Apparently there have been schisms within the [SCOPE.sChar('power_character').GetPartyName], which in turn have led to their loyalties to the faction to waver.\n\nPublicly supporting these dissenters would surely end with hostilities between the two [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRulerTitle]s of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]."
 pbc_event.8.a: "If we control the Senate, why would [SCOPE.sChar('power_character').GetHerHis] opinion matter?"
 pbc_event.8.b: "We will not entertain these dissenters."
 pbc_event.10.t: "The Troubling [SCOPE.sChar('power_character').GetFamilyDisplayName] Clan"
 pbc_event.10.desc.a: "The [SCOPE.sChar('power_character').GetFamilyDisplayName] have long been proponents of reducing the central authority of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]. They argue that, for far too long, our people have moved to our larger villages and cities, like [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName], forsaking our old ways and smaller towns.\n\n[SCOPE.sChar('power_character').GetName] argues that we need to repopulate all the land we have left behind, as our traditions are closely connected to these tracts and villages. Many have already started backing [SCOPE.sChar('power_character').GetHerHis] thoughts."
 pbc_event.10.desc.b: "The [SCOPE.sChar('power_character').GetFamilyDisplayName] have long been proponents of increasing the central authority of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]. They argue that we have waited far too long, and that to build a stronger country we have to leave some of our tribal roots behind.\n\nSpeaking at length of all the great things we can do together, if we are only willing to band together in larger cities, [SCOPE.sChar('power_character').GetName] has collected quite an impressive group of supporters backing [SCOPE.sChar('power_character').GetHerHim]. Now they are demanding that we start working on the infrastructure needed to support such an undertaking."
 pbc_event.10.a: "It will be as [SCOPE.sChar('power_character').GetSheHe] says."
 pbc_event.10.b: "The [SCOPE.sChar('power_character').GetFamilyDisplayName] family are only out to cause more trouble."
 pbc_event.11.t: "A Scientific Breakthrough!"
 pbc_event.11.desc: "One of our researchers, [SCOPE.sChar('power_character').GetName], thinks [SCOPE.sChar('power_character').GetSheHe] is just about to make a notable scientific breakthrough in the research [SCOPE.sChar('power_character').GetSheHe] is currently working on. All that is needed is some more supplies and funds for the next couple of years.\n\nTo be able to get [SCOPE.sChar('power_character').GetHerHis] hands on some of these [SCOPE.sChar('power_character').GetSheHe] has personally asked our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRulerTitle], [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName], if [SCOPE.sChar('power_character').GetSheHe] can be given access to them. The rest of our researchers would certainly suffer if we were to make this move, but maybe it is worth it after all?"
 pbc_event.11.a: "[SCOPE.sChar('power_character').GetPraenomen] will get everything he needs."
 pbc_event.11.b: "We are not going to squander our resources on one researcher."
 pbc_event.11.c: "We can set aside some new funds for [SCOPE.sChar('power_character').GetPraenomen]."
 pbc_event.11.d: "There are no funds to set aside, but [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetPraenomen] thinks [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetSheHe] knows the solution."
 pbc_event.12.t: "Troubling Developments"
 pbc_event.12.desc: "Recently we have seen that our [SCOPE.sChar('power_character').GetOffice.GetName], [SCOPE.sChar('power_character').GetName], as well as those under [SCOPE.sChar('power_character').GetHerHis] charge, have been doing a disappointing job. It seems people having issues with them keep reporting back to us how difficult they are to work with.\n\nWhen talking to the [SCOPE.sChar('power_character').GetWomanMan], [SCOPE.sChar('power_character').GetSheHe] claims it is simply a matter of bureaucracy being difficult, and that the funds for [SCOPE.sChar('power_character').GetHerHis] office has been lacking lately. [SCOPE.sChar('power_character').GetSheHe|U] makes sure to mention repeatedly that it would most likely work out, if only they were given more funds to work with."
 pbc_event.12.a: "The corrupt traitor will not be given anything."
 pbc_event.12.b: "\"Here! Silver! Are you happy now, [SCOPE.sChar('power_character').GetPraenomen]?!\""
 pbc_event.12.c: "The only reward for a traitor is the dungeon."
