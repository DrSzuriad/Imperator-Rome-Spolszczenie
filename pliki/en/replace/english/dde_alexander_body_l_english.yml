In it, lies the body of the most revered of men: Alexander. His victories almost innumerable, this man had a vision the likes of which has not been seen since. [SCOPE.sP('body_province').Custom('why_is_there_a_body_here')]\n\nSuch a man deserves to be left in peace for his eternal slumber, but various voices in our armies cry out for differing treatment of the remains of this hero, once feared and admired in equal measure."
