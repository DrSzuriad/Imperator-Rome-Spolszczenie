 country_diplomacy.36.desc: "We have long been under the control of [SCOPE.sCountry('overlord_country').GetRuler.GetName] and [SCOPE.sCountry('overlord_country').GetName], but our people have grown restless as our overlord is growing more unfit to rule by the day. Now a lot of our advisors and peers are asking us to cut the bonds to the leadership [SCOPE.sCountry('overlord_country').GetCapital.GetName] and become independent."
 country_diplomacy.36.a: "Our people deserves freedom from [SCOPE.sCountry('overlord_country').GetName]."
 country_diplomacy.36.b: "Yet we will remain loyal."
 country_diplomacy.37.t: "Unruly Subject"
 country_diplomacy.37.desc: "Under the guidance of [SCOPE.sCountry('vassal_country').GetRuler.GetName], [SCOPE.sCountry('vassal_country').GetName] has started questioning our leadership, and they have grown unruly. Now they have officially grown hostile to our rule, and are starting to ask for their and other subjects' leaders to cut the bonds to [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName] and start ruling themselves."
 country_diplomacy.37.a: "Traitor!"
 country_diplomacy.38.t: "[ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] and the [SCOPE.sCountry('overlord_country').GetAdjective] Treaty"
 country_diplomacy.38.desc: "Over time the state and the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] people have come to be seen not as a tribe but a civilized country, much like [SCOPE.sCountry('overlord_country').GetName]. It is only fitting then that the treaty that our two nations have with each other be re-negotiated.\nWe are no longer expected to send our young men to die in the wars of the [SCOPE.sCountry('overlord_country').GetAdjective], instead a timely payment of monetary tribute will ensure their continued protection of our interests."
 country_diplomacy.38.a: "May our friendship last a thousand years."
 country_diplomacy.39.t: "[SCOPE.sCountry('tributary_more').GetAdjective] Gratitude"
 country_diplomacy.39.desc: "The protection we have offered [SCOPE.sCountry('tributary_more').GetAdjective] have made a lasting impression on the people. They have approached us asking to be more closely integrated into our country."

 country_diplomacy.39.b: "Our current arrangement is fine."
 country_diplomacy.40.t: "[SCOPE.sCountry('tributary_enough').GetAdjective] Tribute Ceases"
 country_diplomacy.40.desc: "Tribute has stopped coming in from [SCOPE.sCountry('tributary_enough').GetName]. The [SCOPE.sCountry('tributary_enough').GetAdjective] people argue that the arrangement of paying for our protection is no longer serving their interests and that they are better off seeking protection by other means."
 country_diplomacy.40.a: "Preposterous."
 country_diplomacy.56.t: "Sphere of Influence"
 country_diplomacy.56.desc: "The [SCOPE.sC('guarantee_target').GetAdjective] people cry out for firmer leadership than that which their paltry government offers. If we are to truly live up to the standards expected of us as a scion of justice and equity, we must take them into our fold, ensuring safety and fair treatment for their citizenry."
 country_diplomacy.56.a: "In the name of peace, we hear their plea."
 country_diplomacy.56.b: "We have other plans in mind..."
